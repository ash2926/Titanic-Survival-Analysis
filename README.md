# Titanic Survival Analysis

This repository contains an ML model for predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The model is based on a dataset that includes various attributes of the passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. The goal of this project is to explore the data, perform feature engineering, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance in predicting passenger survival.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the famous Titanic dataset, which can be found in the `data` directory. It consists of CSV file:

- `train.csv`: This file contains the training set, which includes the target variable (survival) along with various attributes for each passenger.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-ml-model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd titanic-survival-ml-model
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies. Use the package manager of your choice (e.g., pip or conda) to install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have activated the virtual environment, if you set one up.

2. Run the Jupyter notebook `titanic-survival-analysis.ipynb` to execute the ML model and generate predictions.

3. Modify and experiment with the code as needed to explore different feature engineering techniques, ML algorithms, or model evaluation strategies.

## Results

After running the notebook, you will obtain the following results:

- Predictions for the test set: The model will generate predictions for the test set and save them in a file named `predictions.csv` in the `output` directory.

- Evaluation metrics: The notebook includes code to evaluate the performance of the ML model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
